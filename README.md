<h2 align = "center"> Premium Fitness Centre Location Recommender (Bangalore) </h2>

<h4 align = "center"> Analysis of Bangalore City, India on neighborhood(venues,location...) Data to find the best locations to open a fitness centre using Foursquare APIs and K-Means Clustering method. </h4>

<h5>PROBLEM :</h5> The problem at hand is to find an optimal location for a fitness centre. Specifically, this project will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a Premium Fitness Centre or a Franchise Gym in Bangalore, India. Finding a suitable location for gym in major cities like Bangalore proves to be a daunting task. Various factors such as over-saturation or no demand ,for the gym/fitness centre that the customer wants to open, effect the success or failure of the centre. Hence, prospective investors can bolster their decisions using the descriptive and predictive capabilities of data science.

<h5>SOLUTION APPROACH : </h5> We need to find locations (Neighbourhood) that have a potentially unfulfilled demand for a Premium Fitness Centre like Golds, Cult, Icon Fitness‚Ä¶etc. Also, we need locations that have a relatively higher Average Income and population. We would also prefer location as close to popular city Neighbourhood, assuming the first two conditions are met. We will use our data science powers to generate a few most promising neighbourhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly Expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.
